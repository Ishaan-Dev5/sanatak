## 1. Introduction

## 2. What is Disaster Recovery?
Disaster recovery (DR) is the process and plan an organization uses to restore its IT infrastructure and operations after a disruption or disaster.
In Jenkins, disaster recovery refers to the processes and strategies employed to restore Jenkins functionality and data after a disruptive event, such as a server failure or data corruption.


---

## 3. Why we need disaster recovery in Jenkins?

Disaster recovery in Jenkins is crucial because a Jenkins master server represents a single point of failure (SPOF) for an organization's Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipeline. The loss or inaccessibility of the Jenkins master can severely impact the ability to build, test, and release software


 | **Reason**                       | **Explanation**                                                                                  |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Protect Against Data Loss        | Jenkins stores jobs, pipeline configs, build history, plugins, and credentials. DR prevents losing all this data due to crashes or accidental deletion. |
| Ensure Business Continuity       | If Jenkins fails, builds and deployments stop. DR keeps the pipeline running with minimal downtime. |
| Minimize Downtime                | A good DR plan brings Jenkins back quickly, reducing lost productivity and stalled releases.    |
| Handle Unexpected Failures       | Servers can fail due to hardware, OS, network issues, or human error. DR ensures the pipeline is not affected. |
| Compliance & Audit Requirements  | Logs, build artifacts, and pipeline history may be needed for audits. DR helps preserve them.  |
| Plugin & Configuration Recovery  | Jenkins uses many plugins. DR allows restoring all configs and plugin versions consistently.    |

## 5. Jenkins Backup, Recovery, and MTTR

### 1. Backup

#### What to backup
- Entire `JENKINS_HOME` folder (`/var/lib/jenkins`)
  - Jobs (`jobs/`)
  - Build history (`builds/`)
  - Plugins (`plugins/`)
  - Credentials & secrets (`credentials.xml`, `secrets/`)
  - Configurations (`config.xml`)

#### How to backup

| Method                | Description                                         |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Cloud/S3              | Use scripts or Jenkins job to sync backups to AWS S3 |
| ThinBackup Plugin     | Plugin-based scheduled backup of jobs and configs   |


#### Frequency
- Nightly or after critical changes



### 2. Recovery

### Steps to restore Jenkins
1. Install Jenkins on a new server
2. Stop Jenkins service:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl stop jenkins
   ```
3. Restore JENKINS_HOME from backup (local or S3):
   ```bash
     tar -xzf jenkins_backup.tar.gz -C /var/lib/jenkins
     sudo chown -R jenkins:jenkins /var/lib/jenkins
   ```
4. Start Jenkins:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start jenkins
   ```

### 3. MTTR (Mean Time to Recovery)
Average time to restore Jenkins after a failure.
#### Factors affecting MTTR
- Backup method (cloud vs local)
- Size of Jenkins data (jobs + build history)
- Automation level (manual restore vs IaC automated restore)

| Backup Method                          | Estimated MTTR      |
|----------------------------------------|-------------------|
| ThinBackup plugin + local restore       | 1–2 hours         |
| Cloud backup (S3) + manual restore     | 1–3 hours         |
| IaC automated restore (Terraform/Ansible) | 15–30 minutes    |
| High Availability (HA) setup           | <5 minutes (failover) |

## 5. Advantages

| Advantage               | Description |
|-------------------------|------------|
| High Availability       | Jenkins' distributed nature keeps pipelines running even if a node fails. |
| Minimal Downtime        | Quick restoration of Jenkins instances reduces downtime during disasters. |
| Data Protection         | Backup and restore of configurations and jobs preserves critical data. ||
| Reduced Business Impact | DR strategy minimizes delays and disruptions to software delivery. |

---

## 7. Disadvantages

| Disadvantage                 | Description |
|-------------------------------|------------|
| Complexity                    | Setting up DR with backups, cloud, or HA can be technically complex. |
| Storage Requirements          | Backing up full `JENKINS_HOME` can consume large storage space. |
| Partial Recovery Risk         | Some data like running builds or workspace files may be lost. |
| Cost (Optional)               | Cloud storage, extra servers, or HA setup can increase costs. |

## 8. Best Practices

# Best Practices for Jenkins Disaster Recovery

| Best Practice                            | Description |
|------------------------------------------|------------|
| Regular Backups                           | Schedule daily or frequent backups of `JENKINS_HOME` including jobs, plugins, configs, and credentials. |
| Offsite Storage                           | Store backups on cloud (S3, GCP, Azure) or a remote server to protect against local failures. |
| Version Control Configurations            | Store Jenkinsfiles, scripts, and pipeline configurations in Git for easy recovery and rollback. |
| Use Plugins Wisely                         | Utilize plugins like ThinBackup or Job Configuration History for automated and incremental backups. |
| Use Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for Jenkins | Automate setup and recovery using Terraform, Ansible, or similar tools. |
| Highly Available Jenkins Setup             | Implement HA with multiple masters or agents to reduce downtime risk. |
| Snapshotting Jenkins Instances             | Take periodic snapshots of Jenkins server or VM to quickly restore to a known state. |



## 9. Conclusion

Branch access policies are essential for maintaining a secure, high-quality, and collaborative development environment. 
**Recommended Practice:** Protect the `main` and `release` branches with enforced PR reviews, CI status checks, and restricted write access for all team projects.

## 10. FAQs



#### 1. Are branch protection rules mandatory?
No, they are not mandatory by default. However, they are highly recommended in collaborative projects to enforce best practices and reduce risks.

#### 2. Can admins bypass protection rules?
Yes, admins with the right permissions can bypass protection rules. However, it's recommended to use this privilege cautiously to maintain workflow integrity.

#### 3. What does commit signing mean?
Commit signing means attaching a digital signature to verify the authenticity of a commit’s author. It helps prevent spoofing and ensures trust.

#### 4. What happens if protection rules are misconfigured?
Misconfiguration may unintentionally block valid contributions or allow insecure changes. It’s important to plan and test the rules before enforcing them.

#### 5. How to apply rules to multiple branches?
You can use wildcard patterns (like `release/*` or `feature/*`) when specifying branch names in protection rules to apply them to multiple branches.

## 1. Introduction

## 2. What is Disaster Recovery?
Disaster recovery (DR) is the process and plan an organization uses to restore its IT infrastructure and operations after a disruption or disaster.
In Jenkins, disaster recovery refers to the processes and strategies employed to restore Jenkins functionality and data after a disruptive event, such as a server failure or data corruption.

## 3. Why we need disaster recovery in Jenkins?

Disaster recovery in Jenkins is crucial because a Jenkins master server represents a single point of failure (SPOF) for an organization's Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipeline. The loss or inaccessibility of the Jenkins master can severely impact the ability to build, test, and release software


 | **Reason**                       | **Explanation**                                                                                  |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Protect Against Data Loss        | Jenkins stores jobs, pipeline configs, build history, plugins, and credentials. DR prevents losing all this data due to crashes or accidental deletion. |
| Ensure Business Continuity       | If Jenkins fails, builds and deployments stop. DR keeps the pipeline running with minimal downtime. |
| Minimize Downtime                | A good DR plan brings Jenkins back quickly, reducing lost productivity and stalled releases.    |
| Handle Unexpected Failures       | Servers can fail due to hardware, OS, network issues, or human error. DR ensures the pipeline is not affected. |
| Compliance & Audit Requirements  | Logs, build artifacts, and pipeline history may be needed for audits. DR helps preserve them.  |
| Plugin & Configuration Recovery  | Jenkins uses many plugins. DR allows restoring all configs and plugin versions consistently.    |

## 6. Advantages

| Advantage                               | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Improved Code Quality                   | Enforces code reviews before merging.                  |
| Clean Git History                       | Disables force-pushes to maintain a linear commit history      |
| Stronger Security                       | Prevents unauthorized changes to sensitive branches.                        |
| Role-Based Control                      | Grants access based on developer roles (read, write, admin).                |

## 7. Disadvantages

| Disadvantage                          | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Slower Development Cycle             | Requires reviews and checks before merging, which can delay progress.       |
| Learning Curve                | New developers may struggle to understand the enforced workflow.            |
| Rule Conflicts            | Incorrect rules or permissions can unintentionally block valid work.        |
| Delayed Delivery | Strict rules can slow down urgent fixes or feature releases. |

## 8. Best Practices

| Best Practice                    | Description                                                              |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Protect Key Branches**         | Apply strict rules to `main`, `release`, and `production` branches.      |
| **Enforce Reviews**              | Require at least 1–2 reviewers for every pull request.                   |
| **Use Status Checks**            | Integrate CI/CD pipelines to run automated tests.                        |
| **Disallow Deletions**        | Prevent accidental or unauthorized deletion of critical branches.               |

## 9. Conclusion

Branch access policies are essential for maintaining a secure, high-quality, and collaborative development environment. 
**Recommended Practice:** Protect the `main` and `release` branches with enforced PR reviews, CI status checks, and restricted write access for all team projects.

## 10. FAQs



#### 1. Are branch protection rules mandatory?
No, they are not mandatory by default. However, they are highly recommended in collaborative projects to enforce best practices and reduce risks.

#### 2. Can admins bypass protection rules?
Yes, admins with the right permissions can bypass protection rules. However, it's recommended to use this privilege cautiously to maintain workflow integrity.

#### 3. What does commit signing mean?
Commit signing means attaching a digital signature to verify the authenticity of a commit’s author. It helps prevent spoofing and ensures trust.

#### 4. What happens if protection rules are misconfigured?
Misconfiguration may unintentionally block valid contributions or allow insecure changes. It’s important to plan and test the rules before enforcing them.

#### 5. How to apply rules to multiple branches?
You can use wildcard patterns (like `release/*` or `feature/*`) when specifying branch names in protection rules to apply them to multiple branches.

## 1. Introduction

This document provides a structured overview of the Feature Branch Workflow — a Git-based development strategy used for managing code changes in a collaborative environment

---

## 2. Why Feature Branch Workflow?

The **Feature Branch Workflow** is a Git-based development strategy where each new feature is developed in its own branch, isolated from the `main` or `production` codebase. It allows developers to work independently without interfering with the stable codebase.
Feature branching provides a clean way to manage different streams of development while maintaining a stable main branch. It encourages collaboration and code reviews through pull requests and ensures features are tested before they’re merged.

## 4. Advantages

| Benefit                  | Description                                                   |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Isolation of Work**    | Prevents incomplete or buggy code from affecting main branch. |
| **Code Review Friendly** | Allows easy peer review through Pull Requests.                |
| **Task Focused**         | Developers can focus on one feature at a time.                |
| **CI/CD Friendly**       | Integrates well with automated testing pipelines.             |

## 5. Disadvantages


---
## 6. Conclusion

**Feature Branch Workflow** is ideal for teams that require structured collaboration, isolated development, and robust code review pipelines. It provides a scalable model for both small and large teams.

However, to prevent issues like merge conflicts and branch divergence, it’s important to **merge frequently** and **keep branches short-lived**.

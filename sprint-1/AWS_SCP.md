## 1. Introduction

This document explains AWS Service Control Policies (SCPs) — a tool used to manage permissions across AWS accounts in an organization. It covers how SCPs work, why they’re useful, and best practices for using them to improve security and governance.

---

## 2. What are Service Control Policies?

AWS Service Control Policies (SCPs) are a feature of AWS Organizations that help centrally manage permissions across AWS accounts. They allow you to define the maximum available permissions for accounts in your organization.
Service Control Policies are **JSON-based permission boundaries** applied at the **organizational unit (OU)** or **account level** within AWS Organizations.

- SCPs do **not grant permissions** but set the **maximum available permissions**.
- They affect **IAM users and roles** in the accounts they apply to.
- If an action is blocked by an SCP, it cannot be performed—even if IAM allows it.

## 3. Why Use Service Control Policies?

| Purpose                      | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Centralized Control         | Apply policies at the organizational level for multiple AWS accounts        |
| Restrict Services           | Prevent the use of unwanted or expensive AWS services                        |
| Enhance Security    | Apply least privilege and ensure policy compliance                            |
| Enforce Governance Rules   | Ensure only approved services and actions are used                          |
|Block Unapproved Usage       | Prevent use of services not authorized by IT or security teams                                       |

## 6. Best Practices

| Best Practice                        | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Attach to OUs, not individual accounts** | Promotes scalability and manageability                                   |
| **Use Descriptive Naming for SCPs** |	Helps identify purpose and scope quickly during reviews and audits |
| **Combine with IAM Policies**       | Use SCPs to limit IAM, not replace them                                    |
| **Deny by Default**                  | Use explicit `Deny` rules instead of permissive `Allow`.                                         |
| **Block Account Escape**             | Deny `organizations:LeaveOrganization` action.                                                  |

## 7. Conclusion

Service Control Policies offer robust governance over multi-account AWS environments. By placing organization-wide boundaries on what actions are allowed, SCPs enhance **security, consistency, and manageability** of AWS usage across departments or projects. When used correctly, they become a powerful part of your cloud security posture.

## 8. FAQs

### 1. **Do SCPs grant permissions?**
No. SCPs only define what permissions are *not* allowed. Permissions must still be granted using IAM.

### 2. **Who can create SCPs?**
Only users in the management/root account with appropriate permissions can create and manage SCPs.

### 3. **Do SCPs apply to the management account?**
Yes, but only if explicitly enabled.

### 4. **What happens if there's a conflict between IAM and SCP?**
The most restrictive policy applies. If SCP denies it, IAM can’t override.

### 5. **Can I use SCPs to allow only read-only access?**
Yes, you can create SCPs that only allow specific actions like `Describe*` or `List*`.

## 1. What are Authorization Strategy

Version Control Systems (VCS) like Git, GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket help developers manage changes to code. A key part of keeping them secure is the authorization strategy, which controls who can access or change what. A clear strategy keeps the code safe, makes teams more accountable, and helps everyone work better together.


---

## Why Authorization Strategy Matters

Authorization is a core part of access control. While [**authentication**](https://github.com/Snaatak-Apt-Get-Swag/documentation/blob/SCRUM-102-mansoor/VCS/Security-Access/Authentication-Docs/README.md) verifies *who* a user is, **authorization** defines *what* that user can do. Without proper authorization strategies:

- Unauthorized users may access or modify sensitive code.
- Compliance and audit requirements may not be met.

A secure authorization strategy helps enforce the **principle of least privilege**, ensuring users have access only to the resources they need.

## Access Levels in VCS

Most VCS platforms provide role-based access control (RBAC) with common roles such as:

| Role        | Description                                                                 |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Admin       | Full control over repositories, user management, and settings.              |
| Maintainer  | Manage repository settings but limited in user/group-level control.         |
| Developer   | Can push code, manage issues, merge requests, and CI/CD pipelines.          |
| Reporter    | Read-only access to code, issues, and documentation.                        |
| Guest       | Minimal access, often limited to viewing public documentation or issues.    |


---


##  Audit Trails

Audit trails are chronological records of system or user activities that provide a detailed history of who did what, when, where, and how within a system or platform.

| Audit Event Type               | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Branch Creation/Deletion	   | 	Captures who created or deleted which branch and when                         |
| Permission or Role Changes     | Logs when user permissions or roles are modified.                          |
| Repository Changes             | Includes push, merge, delete, and other git-related changes.               |
| Merge Requests / Pull Requests | Tracks PR creation, reviewers, approvals, merge status    |
| User Activity Monitoring       | Records user actions during their session to support traceability.         |

Stored in:
- Git logs
- VCS platform logs (GitHub/GitLab)
- External SIEM tools (Splunk, ELK)


Audit logs are vital for:
- Meeting compliance requirements (e.g., SOC 2, ISO 27001)
- Detecting unusual or unauthorized behavior
- Root cause analysis of production issue

## Integration with Identity Providers

Modern VCS platforms support integration with Identity Providers (IdPs) to centralize and streamline access management. Common protocols and services include:

| Protocol / Service  | Description                                               |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| OAuth2              | Authorization framework used by GitHub, Google, etc.     |
| LDAP / Active Directory | Directory service used in enterprise environments.     |
| SSO (Single Sign-On)| One-click access via corporate credentials.              |

## Advantages

| Advantage                                             | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Enhanced Security                                     | Prevents unauthorized access and changes to code.                          |
|Enables Role-Based Team Structure                             |  Separate roles across devs, reviewers, and admins              |
| IdP/SSO Integration                                   | Streamlines access management across multiple systems.                     |

## Disadvantages

| Disadvantage                                             | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Configuration Complexity                                | Requires careful setup and management to avoid misconfigurations.          |
| Risk of Over-Permission                                 | Mistakes in role assignment can expose sensitive data.                      |
| External Dependency on IdPs                             | Downtime in SSO/IdP services can block access for all users.                |

## Best Practices

| Practice                          | Description                             |
|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
|  Enforce MFA                    | Add another layer of security           |
|  Disable Direct Push to Main    | Use protected branches                  |
|  Enable Code Review Workflow    | Require approval before merge           |
|  Regularly Audit Access         | Remove stale or unused accounts         |
|  Use Personal Access Tokens     | For CLI usage instead of passwords      |
|  Monitor Audit Logs             | Regular review for anomalies            |

##  Conclusion

A well-designed **Authn & Authz** strategy in VCS ensures secure, auditable, and efficient collaboration.  
We recommend adopting **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** and **SSO** with audit logging for all production-level repositories.

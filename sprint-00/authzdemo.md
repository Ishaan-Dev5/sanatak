## Introduction

Version Control Systems (VCS) like Git, Bitbucket, GitHub, and GitLab are foundational tools in software development for managing changes to source code. One of the most crucial components of any secure VCS implementation is the **authorization strategy**, which determines *who* can access *what* and *what level of control* each user has. A well-defined authorization strategy ensures security, accountability, and productivity across development teams.

> Note: For details about **authentication mechanisms**, refer to the [Authentication Documentation](https://github.com/Snaatak-Cloudops-Crew/documentation/blob/scrum-97-abhishek-saini/VCS/Security-Access/Authentication-Docs/README.md).

## Why Authorization Strategy Matters

Authorization is a core part of access control. While [**authentication**](https://github.com/Snaatak-Cloudops-Crew/documentation/blob/scrum-97-abhishek-saini/VCS/Security-Access/Authentication-Docs/README.md) verifies *who* a user is, **authorization** defines *what* that user can do. Without proper authorization strategies:

- Unauthorized users may access or modify sensitive code.
- Teams may struggle with productivity due to excessive or insufficient permissions.
- Regulatory and compliance audits may fail due to lack of control or traceability.

A secure authorization strategy helps enforce the **principle of least privilege**, ensuring users have access only to the resources they need.

## Access Levels in VCS

Most VCS platforms provide role-based access control (RBAC) with common roles such as:

| Role        | Description                                                                 |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Admin       | Full control over repositories, user management, and settings.              |
| Maintainer  | Manage repository settings but limited in user/group-level control.         |
| Developer   | Can push code, manage issues, merge requests, and CI/CD pipelines.          |
| Reporter    | Read-only access to code, issues, and documentation.                        |
| Guest       | Minimal access, often limited to viewing public documentation or issues.    |

Many platforms also support branch protections, file-level permissions, and tag restrictions for finer control.

## Audit Trails

| Audit Event Type               | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Login Attempts and Sessions    | Tracks all successful and failed login activities.                         |
| Permission or Role Changes     | Logs when user permissions or roles are modified.                          |
| Repository Changes             | Includes push, merge, delete, and other git-related changes.               |
| Protected Branch Access Events | Logs events related to rules bypassing or changes in branch protection.    |
| User Activity Monitoring       | Records user actions during their session to support traceability.         |

Audit logs are vital for:

- Meeting compliance requirements (e.g., SOC 2, ISO 27001)
- Performing forensic investigations
- Detecting unusual or unauthorized behavior
- Root cause analysis of production issues

## Integration with Identity Providers

Modern VCS platforms support integration with Identity Providers (IdPs) to centralize and streamline access management. Common protocols and services include:

| Protocol / Service  | Description                                               |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| OAuth2              | Authorization framework used by GitHub, Google, etc.     |
| LDAP / Active Directory | Directory service used in enterprise environments.     |
| SAML                | Common enterprise SSO protocol (used with Okta, Azure AD).|
| SSO (Single Sign-On)| One-click access via corporate credentials.              |

**Benefits of IdP integration**:

- Centralized control for onboarding/offboarding users
- Consistent password/session policies
- Reduced administrative overhead
- Enhanced security posture

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

| Mistake                                  | Description                                                                 | Impact                             |
|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Granting Everyone Admin Access           | Assigning elevated privileges to all users without business need.          | Increases security and data loss risk. |
| No Role Audits                           | Never reviewing or cleaning up roles over time.                            | Former employees may retain access. |
| Weak Branch Protections                  | Allowing direct commits to main branches.                                  | Accidental or unauthorized changes. |
| Skipping IdP Integration                 | Managing credentials manually instead of using SSO or IdP.                 | Higher maintenance and lower security. |
| Overreliance on Default Settings         | Not customizing permissions for your team/project needs.                   | May result in under- or over-permissioning. |

|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Apply Principle of Least Privilege           | Grant users only the access they need to perform their job.                 |
| Use Group-Based Role Assignments             | Assign permissions via groups for scalability and manageability.           |
| Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)    | Adds additional protection for authentication processes.                    |
| Protect Main and Critical Branches           | Enable merge reviews, restrict force pushes, and enforce CI checks.        |
| Schedule Regular Access Audits               | Periodically validate permissions to remove unnecessary access.             |
| Maintain Centralized Access via IdPs         | Manage all access from a single trusted identity provider.                  |
| Monitor Audit Logs                           | Regularly inspect logs to detect suspicious activity.                       |

## Conclusion

Authorization strategy in VCS is essential for secure and efficient software development. It ensures that only the right individuals have the right access, mitigates risk, and enhances operational transparency.
